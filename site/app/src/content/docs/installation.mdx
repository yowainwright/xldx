# Installation

Install xldx using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install xldx

# yarn
yarn add xldx

# pnpm
pnpm add xldx

# bun
bun add xldx
```

## Browser Usage

For browser environments, import from the main entry point:

```typescript
import { Xldx } from "xldx";

const xldx = new Xldx(data);
xldx.createSheet({ name: "Sheet1" }, { key: "col1" });

// Download in browser
await xldx.download("file.xlsx");

// Or get as Blob
const blob = await xldx.toBlob();

// Or get as Uint8Array
const bytes = await xldx.toUint8Array();
```

## Node.js Usage

For Node.js environments, you get additional methods for file system operations:

```typescript
import { Xldx } from "xldx";

const xldx = new Xldx(data);
xldx.createSheet({ name: "Sheet1" }, { key: "col1" });

// Write to file
await xldx.write("output.xlsx");

// Or get as Buffer
const buffer = await xldx.toBuffer();
```

## TypeScript

xldx is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```typescript
import { Xldx, type ColumnDefinition, type SheetOptions } from "xldx";

const columns: ColumnDefinition[] = [
  { key: "name", header: "Name" },
  { key: "value", header: "Value" },
];

const options: SheetOptions = {
  name: "MySheet",
};
```
